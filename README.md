# Revenge of the Recycling System

This repo contains the Thurs-40 team's code for Engineering 1P13 project 3. This project aims to improve recycling sorting systems using Quanser Labs simulation. In the simulation, the code will control the organizing, sorting, and disposal of waste that comes into the facility. Most of the scripts were provided for the set-up of the simulation by the course instructors. To access the code that Thurs-40 developed, visit P3_project\\student_files\\project_code.py
